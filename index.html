                Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India
                internationally for close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him
                the
                second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all
                time, behind Viv Richards. Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011
                Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India. He had previously been named
                "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament.

                2008,

                November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's
                highest civilian award. As of 2021, he is the youngest recipient to date and was the first sportsperson
